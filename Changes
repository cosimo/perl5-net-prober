Revision history for Net::Prober

0.07 - Mon Aug  6 15:50:55 Europe/Oslo 2012

    Net::Prober now requires perl 5.10.0, which was released in 2007.

    Fixed icmp probing on Win32 when user has no admin powers.
      Thanks to CPAN testers once again!

0.06 - Tue Jul 17 09:22:19 Europe/Oslo 2012

    Changed 'proto' to 'protocol' in the probe arguments (...)

    Changed default ping protocol when you don't have
      superuser privileges. tcp pings in most cases report
      hosts down incorrectly.

    IMAP probing through SSL doesn't work at the moment.

0.05 - Wed Oct 26 16:10:36 Europe/Oslo 2011

    Fixed a flapping test in t/http.t due to some changes
      in the tested website content.

0.04 - Sun Jul 31 09:49:44 Europe/Oslo 2011

    Fixed a port name conversion test failure on Solaris.

0.03 - Sat May 21 09:39:01 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    Removed all '//' operator usage to make the
      module work on perl < 5.10

0.02 - Thu May 19 20:38:58 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    Make sure probe_http() returns "ok" as "0" or "1"
      and not blank. That happened for connection refused
      errors for example.

0.01 - Thu May 19 09:25:01 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    First CPAN release
