Revision history for Net::Prober

0.02 - Thu May 19 20:38:58 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    Make sure probe_http() returns "ok" as "0" or "1"
      and not blank. That happened for connection refused
      errors for example.

0.01 - Thu May 19 09:25:01 Australia/Melbourne 2011

    First CPAN release
